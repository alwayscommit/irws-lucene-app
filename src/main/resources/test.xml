POLITICIANS,  PARTY PREFERENCES 

   Summary:  Newspapers in the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
   Macedonia have published the results of opinion polls, 
   indicating the relative popularity of politicians, 
   political parties, and attitudes toward the political system. 

   The 22-23 January edition of the Skopje newspaper VECER in 
Macedonian published on pages 6-7 the results of an opinion poll 
conducted by the "BriMa" agency in November 1993. According to 
VECER, 1,036 respondents were classified by age and residence, but 
the paper did not explain the methodology or give the margin of 
error.  For the purpose of comparison, the paper cited the results 
of an unidentified poll made in May 1993. The approval/disapproval 
ratings, in percent, for ten Macedonian politicians were: 

                                           November 1993    May 1993 

Kiro Gligorov, President of the Republic      76/15           78/13 

Vasil Tupurkovski, former Macedonian          50/36           43/37 
   official in Federal Yugoslavia 

Ljubomir Frckovski, Interior Minister         50/42           42/43 

Stojan Andov, Parliamentary Chairman          48/41           48/39 

Branko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister            46/41           44/38 

Vlado Popovski, Defense Minister              41/41           36/37 

Stevo Crvenkovski, Foreign Minister           40/43   No Data Given 

Petar Gosev, Democratic Party leader          34/53           40/42 

Todor Petrov, Independent parliamentarian     32/53   No Data Given 

Nikola Popovski, Social Democratic            29/46           32/42 
   Party parliamentarian 

   VECER noted that President Gligorov's very high approval rating 
of 90 percent among those over age 65 fell off to a still high 70 
percent among respondents between 18 and 24.  Residents of Skopje 
ranked the politicians in a slightly different order from the 
ranking given by the whole sample: Gligorov, Tupurkovski, Frckovski, 
Andov, Gosev, Branko Crvenkovski, Vlado Popovski, Petrov, Nikola 
Popovski, and Stevo Crvenkovski. 

   The results of a series of opinion polls conducted by the Agency 
for Public Opinion Research and published "exclusively" by the 
Skopje weekly PULS newspaper, confirmed Gligorov's substantial lead 
in popularity among political figures.  According to the 31 December 
1993 issue of PULS (pages 16-18), the agency gathered the data by 
means of telephone interviews with 300 residents in the Republic of 
Macedonia during 20-24 December. PULS also provided data from 
surveys made in March, June, and September for comparison.  Some of 
the following percentages are approximate values that were derived 
from the graph published by the paper: 

                         March       June      September    December 

Kiro Gligorov             87          82.33      89.33           89

   On pages 6 and 7 of its 15-16 January issue, VECER also published 
the results of a November 1993 survey on party preferences. 
"BriMa," working with the Gallup organization, interviewed 1,036 
people. 

   Question: "If elections were held today, for which party would 
you vote?" (all numbers are percentages) 

SDSM (Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia)  22.8 
VMRO-DPMNE                                      11.2 
Democratic Party (DP, led by Petar Gosev)        6.3 
Socialist Party                                  3.3 
Liberal Party (LP)                               3.2 
Workers Party                                    2.9 
PCERM (Party for the Full Emancipation of 
    Romanies in Macedonia)                       1.8 
Democratic Party of Turks in Macedonia           0.8 
MAAK                                             0.3 
Another party                                    4.0 
Undecided                                       18.6 
Would not vote                                   6.6 

   VECER noted that some parties fared better in certain cities than 
their overall scores indicate.  For example, the DP was about twice 
as popular in Skopje as elsewhere, getting 12.1 percent in the 
capital; the VMRO-DPMNE was more popular in Bitola, getting 15.7 
percent, than in the remainder of the country; and the LP in the 
Bregalnica area got the support of 10.6 percent, substantially 
higher than the 3.2 percent support it received overall. 

   Question: "Do you have confidence in the following parties?" (all 
numbers are percentages) 

              Yes           No       Do Not Know 

SDSM           28           51          21 
VMRO-DPMNE     15           72          14 
LP             19           59          22 
PDP-NDP*       20           73           7 

*Party for Democratic Prosperity-People's Democratic Party 

   The poll clearly indicated that Macedonians have little 
confidence in any of the parties currently active in the country. 
Respondents were also asked whether it would be good for the country 
to have elections sooner than scheduled; 62 percent agreed, 20 
percent disagreed, and 18 percent did not know. These findings were 
correlated with party preferences, producing the following results: 
Of those who would vote for the SDSM, 54 percent wanted elections 
soon, while 34 percent were against early elections. However, 80 
percent of VMRO-DPMNE supporters favored elections soon, as did 79 
percent of LP supporters and 71 percent of DP supporters. While 80 
percent of those surveyed thought that a person should vote (14 
percent did not agree), only 40 percent thought that it was very 
important which party won the elections and 27 percent thought it 
was somewhat significant.
